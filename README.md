## API Integrations

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented

#### Weather Data
- **Open-Meteo API**: Free weather API providing current conditions and 5-day forecasts
  - Global coverage for 8 major cities
  - Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, weather conditions
  - No API key required

#### Disaster Monitoring
- **USGS Earthquake API**: Real-time earthquake data from multiple endpoints
  - Automatic fallback between significant, 2.5+, and 1.0+ magnitude feeds
  - Earthquake location, magnitude, depth, tsunami warnings
  - No API key required

#### Time Synchronization
- **WorldTimeAPI**: Accurate UTC time for consistent timestamps across all data

### üöß Planned Integrations

#### Enhanced Weather Data
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Premium weather alerts and detailed forecasts
- **Visual Crossing API**: Historical data and extended forecasts
- **Tomorrow.io API**: Webhook support for real-time updates

#### Additional Disaster Sources
- **NOAA Weather API**: Severe weather alerts and warnings
- **Emergency Management APIs**: Local emergency alerts and notifications
- **Fire Information APIs**: Real-time wildfire data

## Deployment Options

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Install on devices for native app-like experience
- Full-screen mode without browser UI
- Offline functionality with cached data

### Kiosk Mode Deployment
- **Android**: Single/multi-app kiosk mode via MDM
- **iOS**: Guided Access Mode integration
- **Chrome OS**: Managed kiosk mode for PWAs
- **Desktop**: Full-screen browser deployment

## Development Requirements

- Node.js 20+ (for latest SvelteKit compatibility)
- Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- No API keys required for current implementation (all APIs are free/public)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd earth-rain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
# The dashboard will automatically start loading weather and disaster data

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Current Functionality

The dashboard currently provides:

1. **Global Weather Monitoring**: Real-time weather data for 8 major cities displayed in a table format
2. **Earthquake Tracking**: Live earthquake data from USGS with automatic fallback systems
3. **Auto-refresh**: Data updates every 30 seconds with visual loading indicators
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data if APIs are unavailable
5. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes with dashboard grid layout

## Mock Data System

The application includes comprehensive mock data for disaster events when real APIs are unavailable:
- Earthquake data with realistic magnitudes and locations
- Wildfire alerts for various regions
- Hurricane tracking information
- Flood warnings and tornado alerts
- Volcanic activity monitoring

## Performance Targets

- **Load Time**: < 2 seconds initial load
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB for optimal kiosk performance
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal footprint for 24/7 operation
